## Features

### Recently Played View

- **Grouping**: Browse play history grouped by day / week / month / quarter / year
- **Sorting**: Play time, title, release date, add date, favorites-first
- **Media filter**: All / video / audio
- **Dedup mode**: Hide repeated plays; optionally dedup within each group independently
- **Episode info**: Series name and episode code (S×E× / SP× for specials) shown on every card
- **Smart links**: Series name links to the series page; episode title links to the episode page
- **Folder view**: Click the folder icon on any card to open a popover showing the item's parent folder hierarchy with direct links — supports thumbnail, poster, and list view modes
- **View modes**: Thumbnail (16:9) / Poster (2:3) / List
- **Full pagination**: First / prev / jump / next / last with configurable items per page
- **Internationalization**: English, 简体中文, 日本語

### Thumbnail Grid Generator

Unlock by clicking the **Thumbnail** view button 7 times within 5 seconds. Once unlocked, a grid icon appears on each video card.

- **Grid configuration**: Freely adjust rows (1–10) and columns (1–12); short videos automatically show only valid presets to maintain ≥2 s/frame spacing
- **Modes**: Deterministic (same video always produces the same sheet, cache-eligible) or Random (fresh frame selection each time)
- **Skip segments**: Skip intro/outro by chapter or custom time range; supports global skip presets shared across all videos; OP/ED auto-detection heuristic
- **Overlay**: Configurable branding label, video metadata block (filename, file size, resolution & FPS, codec, audio, duration), per-frame timestamp badges at 6 configurable positions
- **Themes**: Classic / Dark / Light / Cinematic / Minimal / Transparent — each with a distinct color palette
- **Fonts**: Automatic download of Noto Sans, Noto Serif, Roboto, Oswald, Playfair Display, Cinzel; custom font upload (TTF/OTF, auto-detected as Latin or CJK); mixed-script branding label renders Latin and CJK characters with their respective fonts
- **QR watermark**: GitHub repo QR code embedded in the header with a gradient color scheme
- **Jellyfin logo**: Semi-transparent logo composited in the header area
- **Output**: Lossless WebP with alpha channel (transparent theme)
- **Task queue widget**: Bottom-right overlay showing all in-progress and completed jobs; per-job progress bar, thumbnail preview, download, and delete actions
- **Lightbox**: Full-screen viewer with wheel zoom (cursor-anchored), mouse drag pan, touch pan, and pinch-to-zoom; download and delete buttons

### Web Player Enhancer

Automatically injected into the Jellyfin web player. No configuration needed.

- **Frame stepping**: F−10 / F−1 / F+1 / F+10 buttons for frame-accurate navigation; frame rate auto-detected from MediaInfo; steps pause playback automatically
- **Screenshot**: One-click PNG download of the current video frame; optional subtitle overlay (ASS and SRT); client-side only, no server files created
- **Mobile double-tap seek**: Double-tap left third to seek back, right third to seek forward, center third to toggle play/pause; seek duration configurable in the plugin management panel (default 10 s, touch devices only)
- **Mobile swipe controls**: Swipe up/down on the left half to adjust brightness (0–200%), right half for volume (0–100%); OSD percentage indicator shown during gesture (touch devices only)

## Installation

### Plugin Repository (recommended)

1. Open Jellyfin dashboard → **Plugins** → **Repositories**
2. Add repository URL:
   ```
   https://thelastfantasy.github.io/jellyfin-suite/manifest.json
   ```
3. Find **Jellyfin Suite** in the **Catalog** and install
4. Restart Jellyfin

> **Jellyfin Suite + Fonts** is a separate catalog entry that bundles Latin fonts (Roboto, Oswald, Playfair Display, Cinzel) so no internet access is required for font acquisition. Use this variant for air-gapped servers.

### Manual

1. Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/thelastfantasy/jellyfin-suite/releases)
2. Extract to your Jellyfin plugins directory:
   - Linux: `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/JellyfinSuite/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Jellyfin\plugins\JellyfinSuite\`
   - Docker: `/config/plugins/JellyfinSuite/`
3. Restart Jellyfin

After installation, a **Recently Played** entry will appear in the sidebar.

## Migrating from Jellyfin Recents

If you previously installed the **Jellyfin Recents** plugin, follow these steps to migrate to Jellyfin Suite.

> The two plugins share the same internal GUID. Having both installed simultaneously may cause conflicts — uninstall the old one before installing the new one.

1. **Remove the old repository**: Jellyfin dashboard → **Plugins** → **Repositories** → delete the old entry:
   ```
   https://thelastfantasy.github.io/jellyfin-recents/manifest.json
   ```
2. **Uninstall Jellyfin Recents**: **Plugins** → **My Plugins** → find *Jellyfin Recents* (or *Jellyfin Recents + Fonts*) → Uninstall
3. **Restart Jellyfin** to complete the uninstall
4. **Add the new repository** (see Installation above) and install **Jellyfin Suite**
5. **Restart Jellyfin** again

Your play history and plugin configuration are stored in the Jellyfin database and data directory — they are not affected by the migration.

## Custom Fonts

The plugin downloads Noto Sans JP and Noto Serif JP automatically on first use (requires internet access). Latin fonts (Roboto, Oswald, Playfair Display, Cinzel) are also downloaded automatically.

To use your own fonts, upload them from the Thumbnail Grid settings panel, or place them manually:

```
<jellyfin data dir>/plugins/JellyfinSuite/fonts/
  custom-MyFont.ttf     ← uploaded via settings panel
```

Supported formats: TTF, OTF (TTC collections are not supported). The plugin reads the internal font family name from the file, so the filename is generated automatically on upload.

## Compatibility

| Plugin version | Minimum Jellyfin |
|----------------|------------------|
| 1.x            | 10.10.0          |

## Development

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Build and deploy to local Jellyfin dev container
make update

# Start frontend dev server (requires a local Jellyfin instance)
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Jellyfin URL:

```
VITE_JELLYFIN_URL=http://localhost:8096
